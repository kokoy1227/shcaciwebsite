                        <div class="text">Having a well-established admissions process facilitates the smooth handling of all admissions-related transactions at the school. According to SHCACI's handbook, the admissions policies are outlined as follows:</div>

                        <h4>Quota System:</h4>
                        <div class="text">A quota determines the maximum number of pupils/students to be admitted for the academic year. Once the school reaches its maximum student capacity, it reserves the right to decline admission for that academic year.</div>

                        <div class="text">Admission decisions are based on academic and/or moral standing, with the school retaining the discretion to accept or refuse admission.</div>

Acceptance is on a first-come, first-served basis. Former pupils/students who meet the school's standards for academic performance, behavior, and attitude may re-enroll starting early February or as announced by the school.</div>

                        <div class="text">Payment of prescribed fees during the enrollment period confirms a pupil/student's enrollment. The reservation fee secures a slot only and does not constitute partial or official enrollment. Full enrollment requires settlement of the enrollment fee.</div>

Individuals withdrawing two weeks before classes commence may be charged half of the total term fees already paid. Those withdrawing within one week of the start of classes may be charged the full school fees. As stated in the fee schedule, certain fees such as registration (for new students/transferees), slot reservation, and school uniforms are non-refundable and non-transferable.</div>

                        <div class="text">The parent/guardian/student/authorized representative must submit a refund request letter directly to the Accounting Office, stating the reason for the refund. For authorized representatives, a letter of authorization and valid IDs of both the person represented and the representative must be provided. Refund requests will be processed within up to two (2) weeks, considering the date of the request, fund availability, and volume of requests.</div>      
                        <div class="text">Requestors can follow up in person at our office or contact us via the Accounting Officeâ€™s landline number (046) 238-5067. Alternatively, the account officer will notify the requestor once the refund is ready for collection. Upon claiming the refund, the requestor must surrender both the official receipts and the enrollment slip to the account officer to invalidate the enrollment for that school year.</div>
